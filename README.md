# solarized_excel
An attempt to shoehorn Solarized into Excel

Note: Excel themes have fewer colours than the dark or light solarized palettes. Thus the lowest apparent contrast base colour was dropped from each theme.

Note: Microsoft has made it hard to find the colours directory (at least on Mac). The easiest way is to save the existing theme (select Page Layout on the ribbon, then Themes dropdown, then Save Current Theme, then make a note of the path to the folder).

For example, my themes path was:
`/myuser/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/User Content/Themes`

Inside that directory is a subdirectory called `Theme Colors`.
